2017-12-06T18:00:49+00:00	@<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt> Thanks for the nudge, couple of minutes in to a solution now.
2017-12-07T17:40:14+00:00	Just finished my 1º #guile #make extension… TIL none of our CI servers have #make with #guile support, and many devs have pre-GPL3 make.
2017-12-09T05:22:29+00:00	Got myself on the #aoc leaderboard this morning(#91)… now back to sleep as its 5am 😪  http://adventofcode.com/2017/leaderboard/day/9
2018-01-09T20:18:39+00:00	TFW you realise it will be quicker to fix build failures for old emacs version than update your old configuration for new emacs version
2018-01-24T07:32:46+00:00	TIL you can use #typescript to make #gnome shell extensions.  Far, far nicer experience AFAIC.
2018-04-26T10:12:53+01:00	Proof you work with strange nerds #0: Your *favourite* co-worker has added “<nav class='reclamantes'>” to your project’s documentation
2018-05-24T05:16:20+01:00	Love python f-strings… however, I just saw a lambda defined *in* one.  Like finding a piece of mouse tail in your fourth pakora
2018-06-09T01:52:17+01:00	Things I never thought I’d say: “Wonder if someone has reverse engineered Shimano’s new gear config system yet?”  (Not on GitHub FWIW)
2018-06-11T02:40:18+01:00	Dropped my #zsh startup from 1.2s to 0.4s by just thinking about it.  Well, that and noticing I was burning nearly a second on a spinlock
2018-06-11T03:01:07+01:00	… and 0.13s by fixing my ``~/build.ninja`` to prefer ``zcompile``'ing whole directories instead of individual files
2018-07-07T22:52:01+01:00	Travelling to Mars seems cool, right?  Maybe not; have to fix go code, and people won’t use ``:syntax on``.  #Missions has been fun though
2018-07-13T09:37:40+01:00	So was Microsoft Surface a really clever Bait & Switch?  A search reveals people gushing over the table, and links to buy the table*t*
2018-07-17T17:52:23+01:00	Stranger on train: “Mind if a eat this sandwich?” Me: “‘course not… assuming it isn’t tuna.” Other random passenger: “Sadly, people who eat
2018-07-17T17:52:23+01:00	… tuna or egg don’t ask”
2018-07-18T15:29:56+01:00	OH: You use the word “logic” in a way which, er… proves you don’t know what it means and is simultaneously utterly devoid of it
2018-07-27T07:14:41+01:00	Work friend: ”It is nice that you’re learning Russian, not so much that I need to merge to мастер”
2018-08-21T21:29:47+01:00	Just finished watching The Handmaid’s Tale season 2; ☆☆☆☆☆. I… words have failed me
2018-08-24T18:04:56+01:00	Reading “Modern Vim”.  Absolutely fantastic, loads of ‘TIL’ moments even after literally decades of vim use.
2018-08-24T18:05:45+01:00	Eddy looks *disturbingly* poised for action too.  All in all, excellent tip jar gift.  Thanks
2018-08-24T18:05:45+01:00	… @<mickey https://mastodon.eads_cs/mickey/twtxt.txt>!
2018-08-26T17:38:23+01:00	@<rafe https://mastodon.eads_cs/rafe/twtxt.txt> So, at some point I’m going to realise you’re a character in *my* Truman Show and you’re
2018-08-26T17:38:23+01:00	@<rafe https://mastodon.eads_cs/rafe/twtxt.txt>… helping me find the exit?
2018-08-28T09:18:28+01:00	Thought: If #vim performed a ``<C-g>u`` equivalent on typing ``[\.!?¿:;]``, the undo tree when writing prose would be vastly improved.
2018-08-28T09:18:28+01:00	… Let’s see…
2018-09-14T16:16:30+01:00	The instant gratification with pygal is huge.  Truly beautiful output in a matter of minutes from popping open the docs.  Just. Use. It.
2018-09-15T06:41:29+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Posted “Vim with day/night colourschemes” especially for you, not promising I’ll bring
2018-09-15T06:41:29+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… back the frequent tips though
2018-09-15T10:32:20+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Really enjoyed churning it out actually; more so now I’ve seen Mickey’s golf.  I’m at
2018-09-15T10:32:20+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… L440 on Tuesday, I’ll drop in for coffee prize!
2018-10-01T15:16:52+01:00	Prepping my talk for Space Saturday(yep, this Saturday).  Realise I’m largely trying to decide whether to make bear jokes or political
2018-10-01T15:16:52+01:00	… commentary.
2018-10-01T15:23:45+01:00	Oh, and I have guest tickets for the 11’up event if — like me — you want to visit the yard and haven’t been allowed in before.  @ or mail
2018-10-01T15:23:45+01:00	… me.
2018-10-05T13:33:58+01:00	Friend tells story of co-worker who explains /everything/ in story form using ST:TNG’s *amazing* Darmok episode as a device… without ever
2018-10-05T13:33:58+01:00	… seeing the loop. 🤯
2018-10-08T08:39:24+01:00	Playing around with GitHub issue replies for @<Nathan https://mastodon.eads_cs/Nathan/twtxt.txt>
2018-10-20T14:36:36+01:00	So, how do folks go about finding a good recruitment consultant?  First time in fifteen years, and it looks full lemon.
2018-10-20T14:46:26+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Ah, good call.  For ref: OoB Mickey suggested the BTC meet up, and they got back to me
2018-10-20T14:46:26+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… immediately.
2018-10-20T16:35:40+01:00	@<leon https://mastodon.gwr/leon/twtxt.txt> Thanks, that’ll help.  Can’t believe how slimy some of the “top” companies seemed on a cold
2018-10-20T16:35:40+01:00	@<leon https://mastodon.gwr/leon/twtxt.txt>… call.
2018-10-22T19:37:40+01:00	@<Kat https://mastodon.eads_cs/Kat/twtxt.txt> Added an image, HTH.  I’ve been thinking about an #awesomewm talk for a little while now, so
2018-10-22T19:37:40+01:00	@<Kat https://mastodon.eads_cs/Kat/twtxt.txt>… maybe…
2018-10-23T21:19:43+01:00	GNU’s take on a CoC-alike is really quite interesting, and looks useful in general.  Perhaps we should replace ours by a link?
2018-10-30T13:11:44+00:00	So… there is a use for tabs in #vim.  Mimic zoom in/out without plugin hackery.  ``tabedit %`` in, then ``<C-w>c`` out.
2018-10-30T13:15:14+00:00	And I guess bonus points for using ``set stal=0``.  Probably easy to get lost though.
2018-11-07T12:21:48+00:00	@<dev_b https://mastodon.eads_cs/dev_b/twtxt.txt> Remembering it is Diwali is *not* the same when Milly isn’t around to send me laddu.
2018-11-07T12:21:48+00:00	@<dev_b https://mastodon.eads_cs/dev_b/twtxt.txt>… Hope you’re enjoying it nonetheless.
2018-11-11T21:13:10+00:00	Timeline is full of people recommending “Little Drummer Girl”; iPlayer catchup of 1º ep reveals it is “Team America” as a period drama
2018-11-11T21:13:21+00:00	… wherein the Charlie character(Florence Pugh) is great, and the others would be improved as puppets.
2018-11-16T05:48:25+00:00	Very smart looking project hosting. • AGPL-3. • Fast and light. • Works without javascript. /cc
2018-11-16T05:48:25+00:00	… @<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt>
2018-11-30T05:35:15+00:00	#aoc 2018 is almost upon us :)  Questioning whether to get up an hour early tomorrow, we'll see…
2018-12-04T08:51:05+00:00	TFW you embark on a new project.  Distilled in to too many words.  /cc co-workers what changes do you want to see?
2018-12-15T18:43:39+00:00	I’ve retired from our #aoc 2018 competition, who will steal my fourth place on our leaderboard?
2018-12-23T08:54:28+00:00	Making an attempt at /office-hours, we’ll see how it pans out.  I encourage *you* to try the same.
2019-01-02T21:36:07+00:00	Catching a “Tea Peter” re-run tonight is a far different experience to its original airing in 2012, cf Jacob Workingman.
2019-01-10T11:02:34+00:00	As someone who *still* has to fix rollover bugs(‘16 1-byte “fix”, GPS 10-bit in April) Y2038 felt distant, not now.
2019-01-15T06:12:46+00:00	@<mickey https://mastodon.eads_cs/mickey/twtxt.txt> I meant “still” in the “catching up with old problems” sense, but…
2019-01-15T06:12:53+00:00	@<mickey https://mastodon.eads_cs/mickey/twtxt.txt> I see no alternative, wishful thinking won’t get us anywhere.  In agreement; nihilism
2019-01-15T06:12:53+00:00	@<mickey https://mastodon.eads_cs/mickey/twtxt.txt>… wins, we lose.
2019-01-23T14:14:39+00:00	Here, it is common to see lengths quoted at 20℃ … Is it localised in other climates? (*Or* how to search away my ignorance?)
2019-02-08T13:52:41+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt> سلام, Becky.  ``sqlite3 .dump`` and ``js -S .`` are your friends; use tools to recreate
2019-02-08T13:52:41+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt>… *valuable* hunks, and ignore rest.
2019-02-11T17:13:25+00:00	If you’re thinking about using Python’s poetry mod[hi, Paul!], be aware it breaks *all* reproducible builds and creates a packaging
2019-02-11T17:13:25+00:00	… nightmare.
2019-02-12T10:19:36+00:00	@<pmitty https://mastodon.eads_cs/pmitty/twtxt.txt> Ping me on the PR and *I’ll* port it to something else.  Note:  I’m *offering* to do
2019-02-12T10:19:36+00:00	@<pmitty https://mastodon.eads_cs/pmitty/twtxt.txt>… the work, we’ll fix it.
2019-02-20T13:48:44+00:00	Just finished my GGS probit.  Not sure what management expected, presume it is “no change required; disinterested parties killed it”.
2019-02-20T13:59:36+00:00	@<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt> Can’t be offered, I obviously don’t meet the minimum 4Y masters requirement.  Sadly, my
2019-02-20T13:59:36+00:00	@<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt>… final ERB project :/
2019-02-20T14:22:43+00:00	@<xander https://mastodon.eads_cs/xander/twtxt.txt> It doesn’t here either.  Nope, would’ve gone to *any* in an instant & even looked at SR
2019-02-20T14:22:43+00:00	@<xander https://mastodon.eads_cs/xander/twtxt.txt>… roles in 2016-12.
2019-02-20T14:25:46+00:00	@<ollie https://mastodon.eads_cs/ollie/twtxt.txt> Thought you knew.  In fact, I thought that was the *exact* conversation we had back in
2019-02-20T14:25:46+00:00	@<ollie https://mastodon.eads_cs/ollie/twtxt.txt>… July.
2019-02-25T05:15:33+00:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt> A stand *really* helps, you can borrow mine.  If it is rideable bring it GWR2 on
2019-02-25T05:15:33+00:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt>… Tuesday, and I’ll have a pop.
2019-02-25T05:17:42+00:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Prime Suspect ‘73 was my fave origin story, but Endeavour sure is nice Sunday night
2019-02-25T05:17:42+00:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… decomp.  Agree on rhythm.
2019-03-07T20:06:32+00:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Thing is I *really* miss those; both new and full.  Are you wearing appropriate lenses?
2019-03-07T20:06:32+00:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… *Huge* difference.
2019-03-11T05:37:58+00:00	Checking yr.no for week’s cycling clothes choice, found omen instead.  Wasn’t that how that 2004 palaeoclimatology documentary started?
2019-03-11T05:38:44+00:00	@<xander https://mastodon.eads_cs/xander/twtxt.txt> Post those toolbox articles to mastodon or at least an Atom feed somewhere.  Really
2019-03-11T05:38:44+00:00	@<xander https://mastodon.eads_cs/xander/twtxt.txt>… awesome, want to subscribe.
2019-03-12T22:43:31+00:00	I’m on sabbatical from tomorrow, and largely out of reach.  SMS → FOAF link → *personal* phone number → maybe email → shout at clouds.
2019-03-14T06:17:36+00:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt> Those cables are supposedly pre-stretched, so it shouldn’t be a problem.  That said,
2019-03-14T06:17:36+00:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt>… yes… but SMS is best method now.
2019-04-21T06:07:48+01:00	I’m giving a talk on quickcheck-type solutions for imperative languages at LoFu ‘19.  Drop in to whine about people needing “real FP”.
2019-07-01T18:12:08+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt> Obvious flaw is surely more likely to be people.  Fex if people are hearing “MMR terror”
2019-07-01T18:12:08+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt>… today, reputable sources don’t help
2019-07-01T18:12:16+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt> Or try listening to a climate denialist.  “Science is wrong.  World got warmer before,
2019-07-01T18:12:16+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt>… science proved it!”
2019-07-01T19:01:25+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt> Well, offers of elucidation to people who think opinions are equally valid are almost *by
2019-07-01T19:01:25+00:00	@<chewy https://mastodon.eads_cs/chewy/twtxt.txt>… definition* worthless.
2019-07-18T22:32:19+01:00	Have been priming a reboot of ``bfm`` this evening, mostly to please everyone's favourite child(but also me).  /cc
2019-07-18T22:32:19+01:00	… @<cass https://mastodon.eads_cs/cass/twtxt.txt>.
2019-07-23T19:01:20+01:00	”Cheat’s eggs Benedict”, where the apparent cheat is “6 tbsp hollandaise sauce”.  Worst. Recipe. Ever.
2019-07-23T19:27:51+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt> Actually, yes.  I’ve planned for ~fifteen, but we’ll see what happens.  Drop in to
2019-07-23T19:27:51+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt>… AW1, if you miss breakfast.
2019-07-24T20:06:46+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> I was looking for the traditional names of the alternative types; veggie one, halal
2019-07-24T20:06:46+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… one, etc.  Appreciate the confidence.
2019-08-05T15:58:08+01:00	OH: “Given Booker is dead, who is the new go-to example for ∞ denial?”  Arguably harsh as a statement, but *feels* like a valid question.
2019-08-07T12:59:32+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> … or in life at large?  “you can’t reason your way out” aso, but believing will fix
2019-08-07T12:59:32+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… that
2019-08-12T19:02:48+01:00	Late to the party, but the Newton Institute are running a fun series of puzzles over August.  Hit me up in the cafeteria/train to discuss
2019-08-12T23:33:42+01:00	@<dan_man https://mastodon.eads_rpas/dan_man/twtxt.txt> I’m sure I’ve heard a few on WbU or Odds & Evenings too; doesn’t mean there isn’t
2019-08-12T23:33:42+01:00	@<dan_man https://mastodon.eads_rpas/dan_man/twtxt.txt>… more fun to be had ;)
2019-08-16T19:24:44+01:00	@<pmitty https://mastodon.eads_cs/pmitty/twtxt.txt> Same as.  Basil has grown *very* well this season, but my peppers are pepper-less.
2019-08-16T19:30:31+01:00	Totally agree with @<FryRsquared https://mastodon.twit_brg/FryRsquared/twtxt.txt> on oath.  We have ethics Qs during yearly reviews, and
2019-08-16T19:30:31+01:00	… they’re hugely eye opening.
2019-08-16T19:31:26+01:00	… Also, another great pick for /childrens/ xmas lectures; du Sautoy, Fong and Scott being recent-ish stand outs for me
2019-08-16T20:22:25+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt> Sadness at them often being marketed “for children”, they’re /always/ interesting.  “RI
2019-08-16T20:22:25+01:00	@<MissLB https://mastodon.eads_cs/MissLB/twtxt.txt>… Late” could be cool, though.
2019-08-20T05:02:46+01:00	@<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt> “interregnum” great word, thanks!  Does really feel like a Carroll-esque Red Queen’s
2019-08-20T05:02:46+01:00	@<blaze https://mastodon.eads_cs/blaze/twtxt.txt>… Race, so yeah… why not.
2019-08-21T11:59:07+01:00	@<mleighy https://mastodon.eads_cs/mleighy/twtxt.txt> Yes!  I’d love a couple of ZipIt Z2s.  We used them for the TrueSite project in the
2019-08-21T11:59:07+01:00	@<mleighy https://mastodon.eads_cs/mleighy/twtxt.txt>… ‘00s, and they’re still going.
2019-08-21T12:03:15+01:00	@<mleighy https://mastodon.eads_cs/mleighy/twtxt.txt> just skimmed the TS PR, 2 breakages in ninety units.  Astonishing.  (A few have
2019-08-21T12:03:15+01:00	@<mleighy https://mastodon.eads_cs/mleighy/twtxt.txt>… /serious/ battery upgrades too.)
2019-08-22T15:12:37+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt> Thanks.  The Gen2 units have a custom backlight fitted along with hi-cap Li-ions, and
2019-08-22T15:12:37+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt>… Gen2.5 have /huge/ suspend sw fixes.
2019-08-25T08:52:32+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt> Don’t use, but… I just don’t like the way they look on “full-size” frames.  Ant runs
2019-08-25T08:52:32+01:00	@<charoug https://mastodon.eads_cs/charoug/twtxt.txt>… 650b, email him.
2019-08-27T17:43:38+01:00	Enjoying The Allusionist, both enlightening and funny.  Rhythm and humour remind me of Charlie Brooker’s Screenwipe.  ✪✪✪✪✪
2019-09-03T19:41:09+01:00	So, while not for me… howl is an extremely nice editor.  Light, fast, easily hackable.  (I’d be tempted with an ``evil-mode``)
2019-09-03T20:57:03+01:00	@<ant_bat https://mastodon.eads_cs/ant_bat/twtxt.txt> Welcome!  That only supports basic vi-like movement, ``evil-mode`` is *very* deep
